### What Problem the User Is Experiencing
Creators understand that hooks matter, but they can't objectively evaluate their own. They've watched their first 2 seconds a hundred times and still can't tell if it's working. They need a way to get outside perspective—specifically, analysis that tells them *whether* the hook works and *why or why not*.

### Why Existing Advice or Tools Aren't Helping
- **"Hook in the first second" advice:** Everyone knows this, but knowing vs. executing are different
- **Self-review is biased:** You know your own context—viewers don't
- **No feedback loop:** Creators post, flop, guess, repeat
- **YouTube Studio:** Shows if people swiped but not *why* the hook failed
- **Friends and followers:** Say "looks good" but miss the subtle problems

Creators need technical, objective hook analysis—not vibes.

## 4. SEO-Optimized Outline

### H1: YouTube Shorts Hook Analysis: Is Your First 2 Seconds Killing Your Views?

### Structure:

#### H2: Why the Hook Is the Most Important Part of Your Short
- Viewers decide to stay or swipe in under 2 seconds
- A weak hook means the rest of your content never gets seen
- Even great Shorts die if the hook doesn't land

#### H2: The 3 Hook Types (And Which One Yours Is)
##### H3: 1. Premise Hooks
- "I tried X for 30 days—here's what happened"
- Works when the premise is immediately intriguing
- Fails when the premise buries the interesting part

##### H3: 2. Visual Hooks
- Something visually arresting in the first frame
- Works when the viewer immediately thinks "what is *that*?"
- Fails when the visual is generic or expected

##### H3: 3. Conflict Hooks
- Tension, disagreement, or surprise right away
- Works when the stakes are clear and immediate
- Fails when the conflict is too abstract or delayed

#### H2: Why You Can't Analyze Your Own Hook Objectively
- You know what's coming—viewers don't
- Context curse: you understand your premise; they don't
- Watching it 50 times desensitizes you to the problems

#### H2: How Shorta Analyzes Your Hook

##### H3: Step 1: Upload Your Short
- Drag and drop your MP4 (published or unpublished)
- Shorta focuses on the first 0–3 seconds for hook analysis

##### H3: Step 2: Get a Hook Effectiveness Score
- Shorta rates your hook on clarity, intrigue, and timing
- Identifies the hook type you're using
- Flags if the hook is too slow, too vague, or too dependent on context

##### H3: Step 3: See Specific Feedback
- "0:00–0:01: Hook buries the lead. The interesting element ('$50K loss') doesn't appear until second 4."
- "0:00: Visual is generic—nothing stops the scroll. Consider opening with the payoff shot."

##### H3: Step 4: Get Hook Rewrite Suggestions
- Shorta generates alternative hook structures
- See 2–3 options for how to restructure your opening
- Apply the suggestion that fits your style

#### H2: Hook Analysis in Action: Before and After
| Before | After (with Shorta) |
|--------|---------------------|
| "So today I want to talk about..." (2s of throat-clearing) | "I lost $50K in 3 days. Here's how." (conflict + stakes in 1s) |
| Generic b-roll opening | Close-up of the most surprising visual |
| Context before conflict | Conflict before context |

## 5. Product-Led Explanation

### How Shorta Works for This Use Case:

1. **Upload Your Short**  
   Drop in your MP4. Shorta works on published or draft Shorts—analyze before you post or after you've seen weak results.

2. **Automatic Hook Detection and Scoring**  
   Shorta's AI focuses on your critical first 0–3 seconds:
   - Identifies your hook type (premise, visual, conflict, or mixed)
   - Scores on clarity, intrigue, and timing
   - Flags issues like: "Hook takes too long," "Premise is too abstract," "Visual doesn't arrest attention"

3. **Concrete, Actionable Feedback**  
   You'll see feedback like:
   > "0:00–0:02: Hook is premise-based but the premise isn't clear until second 4. Front-load the interesting element."
   > "Opening shot is generic. Your most compelling visual is at 0:12—consider moving it to second 1."

4. **Hook Rewrite Suggestions**  
   Shorta doesn't just diagnose—it offers alternatives:
   - "Option 1: Start with the conflict ('I almost quit')—then context"
   - "Option 2: Open on the payoff visual, then explain"
   - "Option 3: Use a question hook ('Why did this cost me $50K?')"
