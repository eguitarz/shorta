### What Problem the User Is Experiencing
Creators want a comprehensive analysis of their Shorts—not just one metric, but a full breakdown of what's working and what isn't. They're looking for a way to *analyze* their video content and get actionable insights, similar to how they might analyze website traffic or ad performance.

### Why Existing Advice or Tools Aren't Helping
- **YouTube Studio:** Basic metrics only—no content-level analysis
- **SEO tools:** Focus on metadata, not the video itself
- **Generic advice:** Tells you what to do, not what's wrong with *your* video
- **No comprehensive view:** Creators piece together insights from multiple sources but never get a unified analysis
- **Post-mortem only:** Most analysis happens after the video flops

Creators need a single tool that analyzes hook, pacing, clarity, and retention—all in one place.

## 4. SEO-Optimized Outline

### H1: Analyze YouTube Shorts: Full Breakdown of Hook, Retention & Clarity

### Structure:

#### H2: Why Analysis Matters More Than Publishing
- Every failed Short teaches you something—if you know what to look for
- Most creators don't analyze; they just publish and hope
- Systematic analysis is what separates creators who grow from those who stay stuck

#### H2: What a Real Shorts Analysis Looks Like
- **Hook analysis:** Is the first 1-2 seconds doing its job?
- **Retention mapping:** Where do viewers drop off and why?
- **Pacing review:** Are there slow spots or rushed moments?
- **Clarity check:** Will new viewers understand immediately?
- **Payoff evaluation:** Does the ending deliver?

These aren't separate analyses—they're all connected, and you need to see them together.

#### H2: How Shorta Analyzes Your YouTube Shorts

##### H3: Step 1: Upload Your Short
- Drag and drop your MP4 (published or unpublished, under 60 seconds)
- Shorta doesn't need access to your YouTube account

##### H3: Step 2: Get a Comprehensive Analysis
Shorta breaks down your Short into four key areas:
1. **Hook Score:** Clarity, intrigue, timing of your opening
2. **Retention Timeline:** Color-coded map showing high-risk drop-off zones
3. **Pacing Analysis:** Moments where the video drags or rushes
4. **Clarity Review:** Sections that may confuse first-time viewers

##### H3: Step 3: Read Timestamped, Actionable Feedback
For each issue, Shorta gives you specific notes:
- "0:00–0:02: Hook is premise-based but buries the interesting element. Move the conflict to second 1."
- "0:07–0:10: Retention risk—pacing slows here. Cut or add visual movement."
- "0:14: Transition is abrupt. Viewers may not follow."

##### H3: Step 4: Use the Storyboard to Fix Issues
Shorta doesn't just analyze—it provides a re-filming plan:
- Recommended scene order
- Suggested hook alternatives
- Sections flagged for cutting or reshooting

#### H2: Analysis for Draft Shorts vs. Published Shorts
| Use Case | What You Get |
|----------|--------------|
| Analyze before publishing | Catch and fix issues before going live |
| Analyze after publishing | Understand why a Short flopped and learn for next time |
| Analyze competitor Shorts | See what they're doing right (coming soon) |

#### H2: From Analysis to Action
- Most analysis tools stop at data; Shorta gives you a next step
- Every flagged issue comes with a suggested fix
- The storyboard turns insights into a re-filming plan

## 5. Product-Led Explanation

### How Shorta Works for This Use Case:

1. **Upload Your Short**  
   Drag and drop your MP4. Shorta works on published Shorts, draft Shorts, and even rough test footage. Anything under 60 seconds.

2. **Full-Spectrum AI Analysis**  
   Shorta's AI analyzes your Short across four dimensions:
   - **Hook:** Does the first 1-2 seconds grab attention? What type of hook are you using?
   - **Retention:** Where are viewers most likely to swipe? Why?
   - **Pacing:** Does the video maintain momentum or sag in the middle?
   - **Clarity:** Will first-time viewers understand what's happening?

3. **Concrete, Actionable Feedback**  
   For every issue, you get a timestamped note:
   > "0:00–0:02: Hook takes too long. The interesting element ('I lost $10K') should be the first thing viewers see."
   > "0:08–0:12: Retention risk HIGH. Pacing slows here—consider cutting or adding a pattern interrupt."

4. **Storyboard Suggestions for Re-Filming**  
   Shorta generates a revised storyboard:
   - Suggested scene reordering
   - Hook alternatives
   - Flagged sections to cut or re-shoot
   - Clear, actionable re-filming plan
