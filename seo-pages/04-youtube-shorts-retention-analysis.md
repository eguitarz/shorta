### What Problem the User Is Experiencing
Creators suspect retention is their problem but have no way to see *where* viewers drop off. YouTube Studio's retention data for Shorts is limited—often just a single average percentage. They're stuck with a vague sense that "people are leaving" but no idea *when* or *why*.

### Why Existing Advice or Tools Aren't Helping
- **YouTube Studio:** Provides minimal retention data for Shorts—nothing like the detailed graphs available for long-form videos
- **Third-party analytics (VidIQ, TubeBuddy):** Focus on tags, thumbnails, and trends—not second-by-second content analysis
- **Generic retention advice:** "Keep viewers watching" is the goal, not the method
- **No content-level analysis:** No tool connects *what's happening in the video* to *when viewers leave*

Creators need retention analysis that's tied to content, not just curves on a graph.

## 4. SEO-Optimized Outline

### H1: YouTube Shorts Retention Analysis: Find the Exact Second Viewers Leave

### Structure:

#### H2: Why Retention Is the Only Metric That Matters for Shorts
- Views mean nothing if viewers leave in 2 seconds
- Retention drives the algorithm: watch time signals quality
- High retention → more impressions → more views

#### H2: The Problem: YouTube Doesn't Give You Real Retention Data for Shorts
- Long-form videos get detailed retention graphs; Shorts get almost nothing
- You know *that* viewers left, but not *when* or *why*
- Without this data, you're guessing at fixes

#### H2: What Content-Level Retention Analysis Actually Looks Like
- Second-by-second breakdown of retention risk
- Annotations tied to specific moments in your video
- Clear flags for: hook failure, pacing drops, clarity issues, weak payoff

#### H2: How Shorta's Retention Analysis Works

##### H3: Step 1: Upload Your Short
- Drag and drop your MP4 (under 60 seconds)
- No YouTube account connection needed

##### H3: Step 2: Get Frame-Level Retention Scoring
- Shorta analyzes each second of your video
- Identifies high-risk zones where viewers are likely to swipe
- Color-coded timeline: green (strong), yellow (risk), red (drop-off)

##### H3: Step 3: See Why Viewers Leave
- Each flagged moment includes a reason:
  - "0:03: Pacing slows here—consider cutting"
  - "0:08: Message is unclear—viewers may swipe"
- Feedback is specific, not generic

##### H3: Step 4: Use the Storyboard to Re-Film
- Shorta generates a revised storyboard based on retention issues
- Re-film only the problem sections
- Publish with confidence

#### H2: Retention Analysis vs. Retention Guessing
| Traditional Approach | Shorta Retention Analysis |
|---------------------|---------------------------|
| Watch your own video and guess | See a color-coded timeline with risk zones |
| "Something feels off around the middle" | "0:06–0:09 is flagged for pacing issues" |
| Re-film the whole thing | Re-film only the flagged sections |
| Hope the new version works | Know exactly what you fixed and why |

## 5. Product-Led Explanation

### How Shorta Works for This Use Case:

1. **Upload Your Short**  
   Drop in your MP4. Shorta accepts any Short under 60 seconds—published or unpublished.

2. **Automatic Retention Risk Detection**  
   Shorta's AI watches your video and identifies retention risks at each second:
   - **Hook window (0–2s):** Is the viewer's attention captured before they consider swiping?
   - **Mid-video (3–40s):** Are there pacing lulls or confusing moments?
   - **Payoff (last 5–10s):** Does the ending deliver on the hook's promise?

3. **Concrete, Actionable Feedback**  
   You'll see a timeline view with annotations like:
   > "0:04–0:07: Retention risk HIGH. Pacing slows significantly here. Consider tightening the edit or adding a visual hook."
   > "0:12: Clarity issue. The transition is abrupt—viewers may not follow."

4. **Storyboard Suggestions for Re-Filming**  
   Shorta converts retention feedback into a practical re-filming plan:
   - Scenes identified as low-retention are flagged
   - Suggested reordering or cuts are provided
   - You see exactly what to film differently
