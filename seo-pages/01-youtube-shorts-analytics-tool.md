### What Problem the User Is Experiencing
Creators are posting Shorts but can't figure out why performance is flat. YouTube Studio shows basic metrics (views, likes, CTR), but lacks the granular retention curves and drop-off data that explain *why* viewers leave. They're guessing instead of diagnosing.

### Why Existing Advice or Tools Aren't Helping
- **YouTube Studio:** Only provides aggregated retention graphs for longer videos; Shorts analytics are minimal
- **Third-party tools (VidIQ, TubeBuddy):** Focus on SEO, thumbnails, and trends—not on the actual content quality of a Short
- **Generic advice ("hook viewers in 0.5s"):** Doesn't tell creators what's wrong with *their* specific video

Creators need a tool that analyzes the *content itself*—the pacing, the hook, the clarity—not just metadata.

## 4. SEO-Optimized Outline

### H1: YouTube Shorts Analytics Tool That Shows Why Viewers Leave

### Structure:

#### H2: Why Your Shorts Analytics Don't Tell the Full Story
- YouTube Studio shows *what* happened, not *why*
- Retention graphs for Shorts are vague or missing
- You're left guessing which second killed your video

#### H2: The Real Reasons Shorts Fail (That No Dashboard Shows)
- **Weak hook:** First 1-2 seconds don't grab attention
- **Pacing issues:** Too slow in the middle, viewers swipe away
- **Unclear premise:** Viewers don't understand what they're watching
- **Poor payoff:** Ending doesn't deliver on the hook's promise

#### H2: How Shorta Analyzes Your Shorts (Step-by-Step)
- Step 1: Upload your Short (MP4, under 60 seconds)
- Step 2: Shorta scans for hook strength, pacing, clarity, and retention risks
- Step 3: Get a detailed breakdown with timestamps and specific issues
- Step 4: See a suggested storyboard for re-filming

#### H2: What Shorta Detects (That YouTube Can't)
- Hook effectiveness score with frame-level feedback
- Pacing analysis: where the video drags or rushes
- Clarity check: is your message landing?
- Retention risk zones: exactly where viewers would swipe

#### H2: From Analytics to Action: The Storyboard Fix
- Other tools stop at "your retention is low"
- Shorta gives you a re-edited storyboard showing *how* to fix it
- Re-film with a clear blueprint, not vague tips

## 5. Product-Led Explanation

### How Shorta Works for This Use Case:

1. **Upload Your Short**  
   Drag and drop your MP4. Shorta accepts any Short under 60 seconds.

2. **Automatic Issue Detection**  
   Shorta's AI watches your video like an experienced producer would. It flags:
   - Whether your hook lands in the first 1.5 seconds
   - Pacing problems (dead air, rushed transitions)
   - Moments where the message is unclear
   - Retention drop-off risks based on content flow

3. **Concrete, Actionable Feedback**  
   Instead of "improve your hook," you get:
   > "0:00–0:02: Hook is premise-based but takes too long to land. Viewers may swipe before the payoff at 0:04."

4. **Storyboard Suggestions for Re-Filming**  
   Shorta generates a revised storyboard:
   - Reordered scenes for better pacing
   - Suggested hook rewrites
   - Visual prompts for each section
