### What Problem the User Is Experiencing
Creators understand the value of pre-publishing checks for writing (Grammarly) but realize no equivalent exists for short-form video. They're posting Shorts with preventable mistakes—weak hooks, confusing pacing, unclear messages—and only discovering these issues *after* the video flops.

### Why Existing Advice or Tools Aren't Helping
- **No pre-publish feedback loop:** Creators film, edit, post, and hope
- **Feedback from friends is vague:** "Looks good" doesn't catch the hook that takes 3 seconds too long
- **Self-review is biased:** You can't see your own video with fresh eyes
- **Post-hoc analytics are too late:** By the time you see the retention drop, the video already flopped

Creators need something that catches mistakes *before* publishing—like Grammarly does for writing.

## 4. SEO-Optimized Outline

### H1: The Grammarly for YouTube Shorts: Catch Mistakes Before You Post

### Structure:

#### H2: Why You Need a "Spell-Check" for Your Shorts
- Writers don't publish without Grammarly; why do creators publish without feedback?
- Shorts are unforgiving—one weak hook and viewers are gone
- The difference between 1K and 100K views is often one fixable mistake

#### H2: What Grammarly Does for Writing (And What's Missing for Video)
- Grammarly catches grammar, tone, clarity, engagement issues
- For video, the equivalent problems are: boring hooks, bad pacing, unclear messaging
- No tool existed to catch these—until Shorta

#### H2: How Shorta Works Like Grammarly for Video
- **Upload before you publish** (not after you flop)
- **Instant analysis** of hook, pacing, clarity, retention risks
- **Specific, actionable suggestions** ("Move this line to second 1," not "improve your hook")
- **Re-filming storyboard** so you fix issues before going live

#### H2: Side-by-Side: Posting Blind vs. Posting with Shorta
| Without Shorta | With Shorta |
|----------------|-------------|
| Upload and hope | Upload, analyze, fix, then publish |
| Discover weak hook after 200 views | Catch weak hook before 1 view |
| Guess why retention dropped | Know exactly which second lost viewers |
| Re-film based on intuition | Re-film based on storyboard |

#### H2: The Pre-Publish Workflow That Saves Your Shorts
1. Film your Short as usual
2. Upload to Shorta *before* publishing to YouTube
3. Review the feedback: hook, pacing, clarity, retention risks
4. Re-film problem sections using storyboard suggestions
5. Publish confidently—knowing you've fixed the preventable mistakes

## 5. Product-Led Explanation

### How Shorta Works for This Use Case:

1. **Upload Your Short (Before Posting)**  
   Think of this as running spell-check before hitting "send." Upload your draft MP4 to Shorta.

2. **Automatic Issue Detection**  
   Shorta's AI acts like a senior producer reviewing your cut. It flags:
   - Hook effectiveness: Does it grab attention in under 2 seconds?
   - Pacing issues: Are there slow moments that invite swiping?
   - Clarity problems: Will viewers understand what's happening?
   - Retention risks: Where are viewers most likely to leave?

3. **Concrete, Actionable Feedback**  
   Instead of generic advice, you get specific notes:
   > "0:03–0:06: Pacing lags here. Consider cutting the pause or adding a visual transition."
   > "0:00: Hook relies on context viewers don't have. Front-load the conflict."

4. **Storyboard Suggestions for Re-Filming**  
   If major edits are needed, Shorta generates a revised storyboard:
   - Scene order recommendations
   - Hook rewrite options
   - Pacing adjustments with timing targets
