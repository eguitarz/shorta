### What Problem the User Is Experiencing
Creators are frustrated and confused. They're posting consistently, following "best practices," and still stuck at 200-500 views while others blow up. They're searching for answers—often blaming the algorithm—but can't pinpoint what's actually wrong with their content.

### Why Existing Advice or Tools Aren't Helping
- **Algorithm-focused advice:** "Post at 2pm," "Use trending sounds"—none of this addresses *content quality*
- **Vague tips:** "Hook viewers faster" doesn't tell you what's wrong with *your* hook
- **YouTube Studio:** Shows you flopped, doesn't explain why
- **Comparison to viral creators:** "Just do what MrBeast does" isn't actionable for a 1K-subscriber creator

Creators need content-level diagnosis, not algorithm hacks.

## 4. SEO-Optimized Outline

### H1: Why My YouTube Shorts Get Low Views: The 4 Hidden Problems

### Structure:

#### H2: It's Not the Algorithm—It's Your Content
- YouTube *wants* to show your Shorts to people
- Low views = viewers are swiping away too fast
- The algorithm isn't hiding you; it's responding to viewer behavior

#### H2: The 4 Real Reasons Your Shorts Fail

##### H3: 1. Your Hook Doesn't Land in Time
- You have 1-2 seconds before the swipe
- Premise hooks are great, but only if they're *immediately* clear
- Common mistake: starting with context instead of conflict

##### H3: 2. Your Pacing Loses Viewers Mid-Video
- Retention isn't just about the hook—it's about every second
- Dead air, slow transitions, and rambling kill mid-video retention
- If the middle sags, the algorithm notices

##### H3: 3. Your Message Isn't Clear Enough
- Viewers don't rewatch to understand; they swipe
- Jargon, assumptions, and inside jokes confuse new viewers
- Every second must advance a single, obvious point

##### H3: 4. Your Payoff Doesn't Deliver
- Strong hooks create expectations
- If the ending disappoints, viewers won't engage (likes, comments, shares)
- Low engagement = algorithm deprioritizes the Short

#### H2: How to Actually Diagnose These Problems
- Watch analytics for *when* viewers leave, not just *how many*
- Self-review with fresh eyes after 24 hours
- Or: upload to Shorta and get frame-by-frame feedback

#### H2: How Shorta Diagnoses Your Low-View Shorts
- Upload your flopped Short (or your next one before posting)
- Shorta analyzes hook, pacing, clarity, and retention risks
- Get specific timestamps and actionable fixes
- Use the storyboard to re-film with confidence

#### H2: From Diagnosis to Fix: A Real Workflow
1. Upload your Short to Shorta
2. Identify the weak points (e.g., "Hook is unclear until second 3")
3. Re-film just the problem sections
4. Post the improved version

## 5. Product-Led Explanation

### How Shorta Works for This Use Case:

1. **Upload Your Low-Performing Short**  
   Drag and drop the MP4 that flopped. Shorta doesn't need access to your YouTube account—just the video file.

2. **Automatic Issue Detection**  
   Shorta's AI diagnoses the same four problems that kill Shorts:
   - **Hook analysis:** Does it grab attention before the swipe window closes?
   - **Pacing check:** Are there any slow or confusing sections?
   - **Clarity review:** Will a first-time viewer understand immediately?
   - **Retention prediction:** Where are viewers most likely to leave?

3. **Concrete, Actionable Feedback**  
   You'll see notes like:
   > "0:00–0:02: Hook buries the lead. The interesting part ('I made $10K from one Short') should be the first thing viewers hear, not second 5."
   > "0:08–0:12: Pacing slows. Consider cutting this section or adding a visual pattern interrupt."

4. **Storyboard Suggestions for Re-Filming**  
   Shorta doesn't just tell you what's wrong—it shows you how to fix it:
   - Reordered scenes for better flow
   - Alternative hook structures
   - Timing guidance for each section
