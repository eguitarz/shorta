      "aiGenerator": {
        "question": "Is Shorta just another AI script generator?",
        "answer": "No. Shorta focuses on analysis and feedback first. Generation is optional and guided by what actually needs fixing."
      },
      "monthlyPlan": {
        "question": "Why don't you offer a monthly plan?",
        "answer": "Building a successful YouTube Shorts channel is a long-term business, not a quick experiment. Annual pricing ensures you're committed to the process and gives you enough runway to see real results. We're building for creators who are serious about growth."
      },
      "chatgpt": {
        "question": "Can't I just use ChatGPT?",
        "answer1": "You can — but ChatGPT is trained on old data and gives you generic hooks.",
        "answer2": "Shorta analyzes recent viral Shorts, extracts what's working now, and matches the best hook to your specific content — not just random viral patterns.",
        "answer3": "It's like having a researcher who watches trending Shorts daily and tells you exactly which hook will work for your topic."
      },
      "niche": {
        "question": "What if my niche isn't productivity or AI?",
        "answer": "Shorta analyzes structure and viewer behavior patterns, not niche-specific buzzwords."
      },
      "creativity": {
        "question": "Will this replace my creativity?",
        "answer": "No. It removes uncertainty so you can focus on creative decisions that matter."
      },
      "generateTime": {
        "question": "How long does it take to generate scripts?",
        "answer": "Less than 5 minutes. Paste your references, enter your topic, and get high quality storyboard instantly."
      },
      "otherPlatforms": {
        "question": "Can I use this for TikTok or Instagram Reels?",
        "answer": "You can — the principles of viral short-form content apply across platforms. However, our current focus is on YouTube Shorts, so the analysis and patterns are optimized for that platform."
      },
      "dataStorage": {
        "question": "Do you store my channel data?",
        "answer": "We store summarized channel data (not raw videos) so the AI can generate the best content specifically for your audience and style. Your data is never shared with third parties."
