## FAQ

### Is Shorta just another AI script generator?
No. Shorta focuses on analysis and feedback first. Generation is optional and guided by what actually needs fixing.

### Can't I just use ChatGPT?
You can — but ChatGPT is trained on old data and gives you generic hooks.

Shorta analyzes recent viral Shorts, extracts what's working now, and matches the best hook to your specific content — not just random viral patterns.

It's like having a researcher who watches trending Shorts daily and tells you exactly which hook will work for your topic.

### What if my niche isn't productivity or AI?
Shorta analyzes structure and viewer behavior patterns, not niche-specific buzzwords.

### Will this replace my creativity?
No. It removes uncertainty so you can focus on creative decisions that matter.

### How long does it take to generate scripts?
Less than 5 minutes. Paste your references, enter your topic, and get 10-20 ranked scripts instantly.

### Can I use this for TikTok or Instagram Reels?
You can — the principles of viral short-form content apply across platforms. However, our current focus is on YouTube Shorts, so the analysis and patterns are optimized for that platform.

### Do you store my channel data?
We store summarized channel data (not raw videos) so the AI can generate the best content specifically for your audience and style. Your data is never shared with third parties.
